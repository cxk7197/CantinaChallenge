# CantinaChallenge

This is my version of the challenge in react native using expo instead of terminal.

If you do not have expo installed go ahead and run npm install -g expo-cli

To use Expo you have to have Xcode / npm / node / yarn installed, download or clone and all you have to do is cd into the project and then run npm start in your terminal!

If you are having issues, https://matwrites.com/get-started-react-native-expo-minutes/ is a great tutorial, or you can just message me :)

Once the expo screen pops up locally on a browser, click on the run ios simulator on the GUI. 

That will bring you right to my app where you can then type into the search field, and then there will be instructions on the page.

There is definitely an easier and simpler way to do what I did here, would love to learn more!
